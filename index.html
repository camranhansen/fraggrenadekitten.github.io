    <p class="module"> <img src="img/road_icon.svg" width="60px" style="margin: 2px 5px -5px 0px;">After attending the <a href="http://munkschool.utoronto.ca/gii/about/">Global Ideas Institute</a> at UofT for the past two years, one overarching theme has been made clear to me:  All ideas live or die by the Last Mile. For an idea to gain traction in an area, it has to be more than good. It has to be designed to <b>work</b> in that area, taking into account the difference in culture between where the idea was engineered and where it will be deployed. Even if someone has the greatest idea, it could fail due to problems that arise during the Last Mile.</p>

  <div class="grid-item"  style="height: 235px; "><h3>Knows what succeeding means to them</h3>
    <img src="img/pen.svg" width="60px"> <p class="module">According to Merriam-Webster, success is "the correct or desired result of an attempt". Success to me is, in my mind quite distinct from achieving the goals you set out to do. When Sir Alexander Fleming was working in his laboratory, he did not mean to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world's first antibiotic. Yet he did by pure accident, with the discovery of penicillin. All would agree that this is also a form of "success". </p>
