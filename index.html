GII is a program in which the participants are presented with an multi-faceted and unsolved problem facing the world. At the end, all participating schools present their solution to the problem presented, in a cumulative final symposium. The participants are aided by lectures bestowed by experts in their respective fields, which provides valuable insight on how to solve the problem. Through all of these lectures, one overarching theme has been made clear to me:  All ideas live or die by the Last Mile. For an idea to gain traction in an area, it has to be more than good. It has to be designed to <b>work</b> in that area, taking into account the difference in culture between where the idea was engineered and where it will be deployed. Even if someone has the greatest idea, it could fail due to problems that arise during the Last Mile.', this)"></td>
